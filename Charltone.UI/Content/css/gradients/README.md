This is the repo for [uigradients.com](http://uigradients.com) - A handpicked collection of beautiful colour gradients for design and code.

Hopefully this little effort will help you draw inspiration and serve as a resource for picking gradients for your own projects. 


### Contributors

A huge thank you to all the contributors. A complete list can be found [here](https://github.com/Ghosh/uiGradients/network/members).

### Contributing

Adding a gradient to the library is super simple. All the gradients are loaded and rendered from a single `gradients.json` file. Currently only gradients with two colours are allowed.

For convenience, the `gradients.json` is the only file which exists in this branch (apart from the readme of course).

To add your gradient, fork this branch, add your two gradient colours in the HEX format along with a name to the end of the json file and submit a pull request. Don't forget the commas!
